          <h2>Losting</h2>
          <p>'Losting' is an invented word, describing that deliberate act of losing yourself in nature without any bearings or ties to our tech, in order to feel yourself anew.</p>
          <p>A jungle contained in a cube of double-mirrors, Losting is a portal into a strange, ever-shifting world as its mirrors oscillate between transparent and reflective, illuminated and dark.</p>
          <p>Lose yourself in this otherworldly landscape, as it contracts, expands and changes constantly in front of our own eyes. Confusing and mesmerising in equal measure, Losting has no ending and no beginning, a mirage in the middle of Vivid Sydney.</p>
          <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 26 - June 17</p>
          <p><strong>Time:</strong> 6:00 PM - 11:00 PM</p>

          <h2>Dandelion</h2>
          <p>This 4,000kg steel recreation of the flower's wispy calyx, also known as a 'pappus', may appear less fragile than the common dandelion, but the pappus is much stronger than it looks. Not only has this flower found a home across much of the globe, but it's able to retain roughly 100 times its own weight in water. And don't forget, folklore says making a wish while blowing it apart will make sure it comes true.</p>
          <p>A testament to the flower's strength and beauty, this installation moves continually in a dazzling dance. Take in its beauty from afar, or head into the pappus dome to be in the thick of it, with hand sensors to send your own light-shifting winds across the flower.</p>
          <p><strong>Content Warning:</strong> This installation features intense lighting and may not be safe for people with epilepsy and other conditions with sensitivity to light. Viewer discretion is advised.</p>
          <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 26 - June 17</p>

          <h2>The Last Ocean</h2>
          <p>The Last Ocean is rubbish. No, really: this massive tessellated 'ice sheet' is made of reclaimed ocean plastic. Taking its name from photographer John Weller's organisation that works to protect one of the most unique ecosystems on Earth, Antarctica's Ross Sea, The Last Ocean is a chance to step onto the continent’s icy wonderland without harming it.</p>
          <p>After swirling between captivating blue and whites during the day, at nightfall, your movements upon the expansive artwork stir the seas, causing them to splash up and shift the ice’s shape and colour under your feet. Capturing the sublime beauty of Antarctica even as it melts and shifts due to warming waters, The Last Ocean is an ode to what we risk losing if we don't limit our impact on this Earth.</p>

          <h2>Elemental</h2>
          <p>Across countless cultures and centuries, the four elements are opposing forces that make up all life, representing the raw power and alchemic equilibrium of our planet. From the big bang to the natural world as we know it, this breathtaking show celebrates these elements - fire, air, water and earth - combining spectacular 80 metre water shooters, flames, projection and pyro technics – making it more than an essential stop on the Light Walk: it's elemental. </p>
          <p>Elemental takes us on a journey from the origins of our planet, through the ages that have defined our land and waterways and delivers us to the world we call home. Jaw dropping effects mix with an original soundtrack to showcase the awe-inspiring and magical moments created when these four elements are at work. </p>

          <h2>Biotechture</h2>
          <p>Buildings aren't so different from bodies: humans are also architectural wonders, having evolved to improve over millennia. Our entire ecosystem, too, is filled with mathematical marvels and smart design - the otherworldly Biotechture imagines what it would mean if our human-made structures were living and breathing. Peeling back the ASN Clock Tower's façade, Biotechture is an otherworldly view into the arteries, bones and all behind the building. It's also a reminder of the beautiful architecture that makes up both our city and the natural world.</p>

          <h2>Lilies</h2>
          <p>Across many cultures, water lilies symbolise truth, purity and new life.</p>
          <p>For centuries, their natural beauty has inspired countless artists across the world – most famously, French impressionist Claude Monet dedicated much of his life to painting them, creating more than 250 oil paintings in his Water Lilies collection.</p>
          <p>These giant inflatable versions of the flower float gently in the water, shining white during the day. As night falls, they light up and glow, offering a meditative kaleidoscope of colour.</p>

          <h2>Our Connected City</h2>
          <p>Unite the city with light!</p>
          <p>Suffusing our skyline with kaleidoscopic colour and spellbinding lighting design, Sydney transforms in a uniformed ribbon of light running across the Sydney Harbour Bridge and through The Rocks, Circular Quay, the Sydney Opera House and beyond.</p>
          <p>Simultaneously, above the city, one hundred and fifty beams cut upwards into the night sky, tracing lines of light across the clouds. Below, on the surface of Sydney Harbour, thousands of individual light sources are reflected in the mirror-like waters of Circular Quay.</p>
          <p>In this expansive visual spectacle, all the lights are coordinated in perfect synchronisation and uniformity. Together, they connect us to our city and our environment.</p>
          <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 26 - June 17</p>
          <p><strong>Time:</strong> 6:00 PM - 11:00 PM</p>

          <h2>Murmuration</h2>
          <p>Murmuration is inspired by its namesake, the natural phenomenon where thousands of starling birds fly in unison at dusk in an awe-inspiring pattern that bends, twists and changes direction in an unpredictable pattern – a way to avoid predators. Suspending 500 wirelessly connected light and audio sources under the trees of The Goods Line, this work recreates this mesmerising and frenetic swarm. Chaos becomes calm in a moment, playfully flying just above our heads.</p>
          <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 26 - June 17</p>
          <p><strong>Time:</strong> 6:00 PM - 11:00 PM</p>
